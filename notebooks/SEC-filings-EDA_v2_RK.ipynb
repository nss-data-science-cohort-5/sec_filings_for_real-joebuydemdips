On August 20, 2021, the Company repurchased and retired 6,849,315 shares of its Class A Common Stock from the Platinum Stockholder at a price per share of $14.60, which was equal to the price at which the underwriter exercised the overallotment option for the secondary offering discussed above. The Company paid $100 million to fund the share repurchase using existing cash on hand. The Company accounted for the share repurchase and retirement under the cost method by deducting its par value from the common stock account, reducing $72.0 million in the additional paid-in-capital account using the share price when the stock was originally issued, and the remaining excess cost of $28.0 million by increasing the accumulated deficit account.

This October 2019 share repurchase program did not obligate us to repurchase any set dollar amount or number of shares and could have been modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. Under the repurchase program, we were authorized to repurchase our common shares on the open market from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions, or through accelerated repurchase agreements, subject to availability of common shares, price, market conditions, alternative uses of capital, and applicable regulatory requirements, at management’s discretion.

Under the agreement, we made a payment of $500 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of 1.2 million shares valued at $425 million that were immediately canceled by the company. The remaining balance of $75 million is included as a reduction to Retained earnings on the consolidated statement of financial position. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the company’s daily volume-weighted average share price during the term of the transaction, less a discount, and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. Goldman Sachs may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the company at final settlement or, under certain circumstances, the company may be required to either, at the company’s election, deliver shares or make a cash payment to Goldman Sachs.

      "58      tlys-20220129.html  On March 14, 2022, our Board authorized a share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\"), pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock through March 14, 2023. The timing and amount of repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock, if any, will depend upon several factors, such as the market price of Class A common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number or amount of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Program, and it may modify, suspend or discontinue the Repurchase Program at any time. Repurchases of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and, if shares are repurchased in the Repurchase Program, it will reduce the market liquidity for our Class A common stock. Additionally, the Repurchase Program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value, and the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.

Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares for cash on the open market, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions or block transactions, or through an accelerated repurchase agreement.

Upon repurchase of the shares, we reduced our common stock for the par value of the shares with the excess being applied against additional paid in capital.
